GDP evolution of the selected countries from 2000 to 2015 showed that China 
experienced a massive boost, overtaking Germany and catching the United States.
However, taking their population, Germany presents itself as the leader in GDP per capita.
Zimbabwe, trailing in the pack by a margin, shows some potential since 2008,
trying to catch up with developed countries.

Life expectancy at birth shows Germany as the leader, with Chile being the 
second, suprisingly. The leader in GDP, the United States, only comes third.
Zimbabwe again being far away from the pack, but rapidly catching up as their
GDP also grows. 

In conclusion, there is a relationship between life expectancy and GDP as the
developed countries have longer life expectancy at birth the the developing ones.
Nevetheless, the leaders of the GDP in 2015, China and the United States, have lower
life expectancy at birth than Germany and Chile who did not their maximum of
life expectancy in the peak of GDP.
